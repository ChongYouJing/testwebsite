var testStory = `Once upon a time, in a small village nestled at the edge of an ancient forest, there lived a curious cat named Whiskers. With fur as soft as midnight and eyes that glimmered like emeralds, Whiskers was known far and wide for her adventurous spirit. She had a penchant for wandering—whether it was to chase fluttering butterflies or to explore forgotten nooks of the world beyond the garden gate.

One crisp autumn morning, with the sun barely peeking through the leaves, Whiskers decided to venture deeper into the forest than ever before. The trees stood tall and proud, their trunks twisted like ancient stories etched in wood. The air was thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, and a soft breeze carried the whispers of the forest to her sensitive ears.

As Whiskers padded along the moss-covered path, the leaves beneath her paws crunched softly. Birds called from high branches, and squirrels darted playfully among the trees. Every so often, she would pause to sniff at an interesting scent—a patch of mushrooms, a hidden trail of ants, the distant sound of water trickling through a stream. There was no hurry in her steps; she was in no rush to go anywhere in particular. The forest itself was her guide.

After some time, Whiskers stumbled upon a small clearing bathed in dappled sunlight. In the center of the clearing stood an old oak tree, its branches reaching wide like the arms of a wise old giant. The tree’s bark was deeply gnarled, and from its trunk grew delicate vines that shimmered with silver-like dew. Whiskers, ever curious, approached the tree and stretched up on her hind legs to inspect the vines more closely.

As she touched the vines with her paw, the forest around her seemed to pause. The wind stilled, the birds fell silent, and even the sunlight seemed to hold its breath. Whiskers, a little confused but unafraid, continued to bat at the shimmering tendrils.

Suddenly, a soft voice—gentle and warm—spoke from the tree itself.

"Ah, little one," the voice said, "you’ve found the heart of the forest."

Whiskers froze, her whiskers twitching in surprise. She looked around, but saw no one. The voice had come from within the tree.

"You are brave to come so far," the voice continued, "for not many venture this deep. But you, little cat, have a gift—an eye for what others cannot see."

Whiskers tilted her head, her tail flicking in silent curiosity.

The voice laughed softly. "You are not like the others. You see the magic in the world, even when it hides behind the mundane. The forest is alive with stories, whispers of ages past, and you are part of it now. Will you listen?"

And so, Whiskers did. She sat at the foot of the oak, eyes half-closed, as the world around her began to stir with unseen life. The trees creaked and whispered, the wind hummed softly through the leaves, and the earth beneath her paws seemed to pulse with a quiet, steady heartbeat. Whiskers listened, and in that moment, she understood that she was no longer just a cat wandering through the woods. She had become a part of the forest’s story—a story that would continue, long after she was gone.

As the sun dipped lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the clearing, Whiskers rose to her feet. The forest had shared its secrets with her, and she felt a sense of peace she had never known before. With a final glance at the ancient oak, she turned and trotted back along the winding path, her heart full of wonder and her mind alight with the quiet magic of the forest.

And from that day on, whenever Whiskers wandered through the woods, she no longer felt alone. For the forest, with its whispered stories and hidden magic, was always there, waiting patiently for her return.`
